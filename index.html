<h5> Here's what you get</h5>

<p>Here's what you get
NON EXCLUSIVE RAP BEATS: Get a full length hip hop instrumental with prearranged sections for verse, hook etc. Most rap beats are 4:00 or longer but none are less than 3:30. You will get a "Radio Ready" version for your vocals. Direct downloads are available right after payment. The Beats will be in high quality (160k) .mp3 format, which is perfect for demos, shows, talent contest, samples and more.
LOOPS and RAP BEATS: Loops are not full tracks! They are 4, 8 or 16 measures long and do not contain verse and hook sections. Loops and Beats are great for creating your own version of the track. Some loops are sections of the rap instrumentals that are from the rest of the site, only shortened versions of it. Get a direct download after payment with a link to the file. Direct Downloads, loops and hip hop beat samples are exactly what is sent (without the voice over).
EXCLUSIVE RAP BEATS: Exclusive beats are yours to OWN. That's right! You will own them forever. After the purchase, a Full Exclusive Beats License will be sent to you within 24hrs and YOUR RAP BEATS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE SITE! This means nobody else can purchase it and you will be the owner of the music/song you create with the beat. Get your rap demo ready today. An Exclusive beat is always shipped out on CD or DVD depending on the file size. You will get a direct download link to your exclusive rap beats as an mp3 to get started, but we will contact you for the shipping info.</p>
   
 <p>Master a single track with this beat, and sell up to 1000 combined royalty-free copies of your music for 2 Years via MP3, Music Albums and Music Videos. Other artists will still be able to buy a license to use this instrumental. Also included is royalty-free use of your music in Live Performances and Radio Play for the entire term of the license. To acknowledge the producer, you must place verbal or written credits in your completed works.</p>    

<p>I didn't get my links?
No problem. You can re-download it from the site. Just use the login button on the home page (top right nav). Enter your email address and request a password if you never logged in yet.
Do I own the track after I buy it and do I get a printed agreement?
No, you do not own the beat. You are buying a non exclusive beat. All non exclusive beats are LEASED not SOLD. You are leasing the rights to use it. By downloading the track, you are bound to the terms and conditions of non exclusive use. All tracks are downloaded from the site and do not come with printed terms. If you want to “own it” you would need to purchase the exclusive rights to it. Most beats are available as exclusive rights if you request them. Prices range from $450-$1200 depending on the beat/producer. Exclusive beat sales come with contracts, separated production tracks and shipped on disk. If you buy the exclusive rights, the beat would also be removed from the site for good and is never sold to anyone else again.</P>
