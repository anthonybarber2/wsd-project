<h2> Great musical History</h2>
4DA Record Beats was formed because of the many requests I got for beats and music tracks. I've been in the business of audio and video production for over 19 years. My music has been heard (behind the scenes) by thousands of people from the east coast to the west coast in Video productions, DVD demos, Kiosks, CD-Roms. I have worked on Big jobs in Big places with celebrities such as Bill Cosby, Jay Leno, James Belushi and Celine Dion plus many more.. Over the years, many have asked me to produce beats and/or tracks for their own projects. Soon enough, it became a daily thing. I wanted to make my work affordable for everyone to help people expand their ability and talent to get them to the next step.
